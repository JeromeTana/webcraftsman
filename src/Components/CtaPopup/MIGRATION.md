# Migration Guide

## Before (Single File)

The old `CtaPopup.tsx` was a single 651-line file with all logic mixed together.

## After (Modular Structure)

### No Breaking Changes

The refactor maintains complete backward compatibility. Existing imports will continue to work:

```tsx
// This still works exactly the same
import { CtaPopup, openCtaPopup } from '@/Components/CtaPopup';
```

### New Modular Imports (Optional)

If you want to use individual components, you can now import them directly:

```tsx
import { SurveyForm } from '@/Components/CtaPopup/SurveyForm';
import { FormStepComponent } from '@/Components/CtaPopup/FormStepComponent';
import { SuccessScreen } from '@/Components/CtaPopup/SuccessScreen';
```

### Benefits You Get Immediately

1. **Better Performance**: Smaller bundle sizes through better tree-shaking
2. **Better Type Safety**: More comprehensive TypeScript support
3. **Easier Debugging**: Clearer component boundaries make debugging easier
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend and modify without touching existing code

### What Changed Internally

- **Split into 10 focused files** instead of 1 monolithic file
- **Configuration-driven form steps** instead of hardcoded components
- **Centralized validation** instead of scattered logic
- **Reusable components** instead of duplicated code
- **Better error handling** with consistent messaging
- **Performance optimizations** with useCallback and memoization

### Testing Your Migration

1. Ensure all existing imports still work
2. Verify the popup still triggers on scroll/intersection
3. Test form submission flow
4. Check that the success screen and Cal.com integration work
5. Verify session storage behavior (popup only shows once per session)

### If Issues Arise

The old component is preserved in git history. You can easily revert if needed, but the refactor should be completely transparent to existing usage.
