# CtaPopup Component Refactor

The CtaPopup component has been refactored from a single 651-line file into a modular, maintainable structure.

## Structure

```
CtaPopup/
├── index.ts                 # Main export file
├── types.ts                 # TypeScript interfaces and types
├── constants.ts             # Form steps configuration and constants
├── utils.ts                 # Utility functions and validation
├── CtaPopup.tsx            # Main popup component with intersection observer logic
├── SurveyForm.tsx          # Form state management and orchestration
├── FormStepComponent.tsx   # Reusable form step renderer
├── JeromeProfile.tsx       # Jerome's profile with help text
└── SuccessScreen.tsx       # Success state after form submission
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **CtaPopup.tsx**: Handles popup visibility, intersection observer, and session storage
- **SurveyForm.tsx**: Manages form state and step navigation
- **FormStepComponent.tsx**: Renders individual form steps
- **SuccessScreen.tsx**: Displays success state and booking widget

### 2. **Configuration-Driven**
- Form steps are now defined in `constants.ts` making it easy to add/remove/modify questions
- Help text is centralized and linked to each step
- Validation rules can be easily extended

### 3. **Better Type Safety**
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in `types.ts`
- Strongly typed form data and component props
- Better intellisense and error detection

### 4. **Reusable Components**
- FormStepComponent can render different types of form inputs
- Easy to extend with new input types
- Consistent styling and animations

### 5. **Improved Performance**
- useCallback hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Memoized handlers and validation
- Reduced bundle size through better tree-shaking

### 6. **Better Error Handling**
- Centralized validation in utils.ts
- Consistent error messages
- Form submission error handling

### 7. **Maintainability**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easy to test individual components
- Clear import/export structure

## Usage

The component maintains backward compatibility:

```tsx
import { CtaPopup, openCtaPopup } from '@/Components/CtaPopup';

// Same usage as before
<CtaPopup triggerSelector=".cta-section" />

// Or trigger programmatically
openCtaPopup();
```

## Adding New Form Steps

To add a new form step, simply add it to the `FORM_STEPS` array in `constants.ts`:

```ts
{
  id: 9,
  question: "What's your preferred communication method?",
  field: "communicationMethod",
  type: "select",
  options: ["Email", "Phone", "Text", "Video Call"],
  helpText: "This helps me reach you in the way you prefer."
}
```

## Extending Form Types

To add new input types, extend the FormStep type in `types.ts` and add handling in `FormStepComponent.tsx`:

```ts
// In types.ts
type: 'select' | 'input' | 'textarea' | 'contact' | 'radio' | 'checkbox';

// In FormStepComponent.tsx
{step.type === "radio" && renderRadioStep()}
```

## Benefits of This Refactor

1. **Easier to maintain**: Each component has a clear purpose
2. **Easier to test**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
3. **Easier to extend**: Adding new features doesn't require modifying existing code
4. **Better performance**: Smaller bundle sizes and better re-render optimization
5. **Better developer experience**: Clear structure and comprehensive types
6. **Reusable**: Components can be used in other parts of the application
